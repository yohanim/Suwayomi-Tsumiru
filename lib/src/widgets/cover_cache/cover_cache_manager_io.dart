/// Cover/icon image cache that survives OS cache pressure.
///
/// The default cache manager keeps at most 200 files in the OS *temp* dir —
/// shared with reader pages, so reading a few chapters evicts most library
/// covers, and Android (or a Linux reboot) wipes the dir wholesale. Offline
/// mode renders covers purely from this cache, so losing it turns the offline
/// library into a wall of broken images.
///
/// Covers are small and long-lived, so they get their own store: files under
/// application-support (durable, app-private) with a cap sized to a large
/// library instead of a page ring buffer.

/// for a Suwayomi thumbnail), so scrolling a library quietly re-fetched every
/// cover past its date. Covers change when the user asks for new metadata, not
/// on a clock: an explicit refresh evicts the entry, and the next load fetches
/// it because there is no copy left — not because it went stale.
